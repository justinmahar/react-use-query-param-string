## Overview

This hook allows you to use a query param string the same way you'd use regular React state (i.e. via React.useState). 

You can also use the getQueryParams() and setQueryParams() functions to get/set query params yourself.

### Features include:

- **👍 Read and set query params with ease**
  - Use query param strings just like you would React state
- **🔄 State syncing across components**
  - Hooks stay synchronized even when used in multiple components.
- **🙅‍♂️ No Router interference**
  - Uses `window` functions that don't interfere with router frameworks.
- **💁‍♀️ Convenience functions available**
  - Use `getQueryParams()` or `setQueryParams()` to get/set query params yourself.

## Installation

```
npm i react-use-query-param-string
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { useQueryParamString } from 'react-use-query-param-string';
```

```jsx
// Will use query param `q` and have a default value of empty string.
// `initialized` will be true after the value has been read from the query params.
const [searchText, setSearchText, initialized] = useQueryParamString('q', '');
```

See the [useQueryParamString docs](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-query-param-string/?path=/story/hooks-usequeryparamstring--page) for more usage details, including static functions.
